TITLE. Precipitation data for D1 chart recorder, 1964 - ongoing.

ABSTRACT. Precipitation data were collected on a daily time-scale from the D1 climate station (3743 m) since 1964. Over time, various circumstances have led to days with missing values. Some of these values were estimated from nearby climate stations.

METHODS. The qualifying days variable is the number of days to which a precipitation value pertains.
Missing dates from the Niwot Ridge data set were determined that crossed month or year boundaries for data up to 2008.  When such missing dates were found, adjacent sites where data were present were identified in a pre-determined hierarchy (see below).
(Method Flag 1) Daily Ratio Methodology:
Total precipitation for the date in question was calculated for the the period 1968-2008, for both the 'Known Site' and the 'Unknown Site', only for days where daily values existed for both sites (missing values and QD's > 1 were removed). A ratio was determined [Unknown Site : Known Site] based upon these totals.  This ratio was then multiplied by the value for that date at the 'Known Site' in order to determine the 'Unknown Site' value.
(Method Flag 2) 
If there was a known total at the 'Unknown Site' that crossed over into the following month, then the known reported total was kept, and the newly determined values were ratio-ed based upon that known total.
Precipitation data adjacency hierarchy:
D1:
1) Saddle (if not in winter [OCT-MAY] due to bias that blowing snow can have)
2) C1
3) AP (Allenspark) -> C1 -> D1  (determine values at C1 for these days from AP, then regress to D1 from those determined values)
4) WP (Winter Park)
